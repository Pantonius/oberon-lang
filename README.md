# A Compiler for the Oberon Programming Language

The [Oberon](http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch) programming language was proposed in 1987 by 
[Niklaus Wirth](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/) as a successor to Pascal and Modula-2. Due to this lineage, Oberon 
is an ALGOL-like language with strong (static and dynamic) typing discipline. The programming paradigm of Oberon can 
be classified as imperative, structured, modular, and object-oriented.

## About

This project implements a compiler for the Oberon programming language as a frontend to the [LLVM](http://llvm.org)
Compiler Infrastructure. It is written in C++ and originated as project accompanying the MSc course "Compiler 
Construction" taught at the [University of Konstanz](https://uni.kn).
